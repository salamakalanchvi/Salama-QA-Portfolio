## Test Strategy 🧪  
This section describes the overall approach to testing:  

- Functional validation of core features  
- Exploratory testing for UI & usability  
- Data-driven testing for inputs  
- API validation using Postman  
- Regression testing before major releases  
- Pass/Fail Criteria:  
  - Feature works as per acceptance criteria  
  - No critical bugs in the workflow  
  - UI elements behave as expected  

## Risks & Mitigations 🧾  
- **Risk:** Unstable build may delay testing  
  - **Mitigation:** Perform smoke tests before full execution  

- **Risk:** Test data dependency may block execution  
  - **Mitigation:** Create synthetic test data beforehand  

## Timeline 📅  
- **Planning:**  
- **Execution:**  
- **Regression:**  
- **Retesting:**
