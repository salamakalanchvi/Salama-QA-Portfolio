📊 Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
🎯 Purpose

This matrix maps requirements → test scenarios → test cases → defects to ensure complete test coverage and traceability.

📋 RTM Table Template

Replace placeholders as needed. Table expands as more requirements are added.

Requirement ID	Requirement Description	Test Scenarios	Test Cases	Linked Bugs	Status
REQ-001	<Business requirement>	TS-001, TS-002	TC-001, TC-002	BUG-001 (Critical)	In Progress / Tested / Blocked
REQ-002	<Business requirement>	TS-003	TC-003, TC-004	-	Not Started
REQ-003	<Business requirement>	TS-004, TS-005	TC-005	BUG-010 (Medium)	Tested


# Notes

- Add or remove rows based on the number of requirements.
- “Status” is optional but helpful in real QA workflows.
- You can maintain this file per sprint, module, or project.
