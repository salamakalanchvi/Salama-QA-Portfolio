# Manual Testing Portfolio 📂

Welcome to my **Manual Testing Portfolio**, showcasing real, structured QA deliverables based on industry best practices.  
This folder demonstrates my ability to plan, design, document, and execute high-quality test activities across web applications.

---

## What This Folder Contains 📌

This section includes all core manual testing artifacts expected from a strong QA candidate:

- **Test Plan** — overall testing approach, strategy, scope, risks, timelines  
- **Test Scenarios** — high-level user flows mapped to business requirements  
- **Test Cases** — detailed, step-by-step validations  
- **Bug Reports** — defect documentation using a standardized template  
- **RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix)** — requirement → scenario → test case → bug mapping  
- **Sample Project:** *Sauce Demo Web Application*

Every document in this folder uses consistent formatting, clear structure, and VSCode/GitHub-friendly Markdown.

## Why This Portfolio Matters 🎯

Recruiters and hiring managers want to see:

- How you **think as a tester**  
- How you **structure your testing work**  
- Whether you can clearly explain what broke and why  
- If your documentation is actually useful (not just pretty)  

This folder demonstrates:

- My real-world testing process and how I think through problems  
- How I trace requirements to test cases (traceability matters)  
- Whether I test just the happy path or actually think about what could break  
- How I report bugs in a way that developers actually understand  
- Documentation that's useful, not just formatted nicely

## Final Note 💬

This manual testing folder represents my real working approach as a QA Engineer.  
Each document reflects clarity, organization, and attention to detail — key qualities every recruiter and team looks for.

If you’d like more examples (API testing, mobile testing, exploratory testing notes), I can add them too.
