# 👋 About Me - Salama Kalanchvi

## Who I Am

I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer with 4+ years of professional experience. My journey to QA is unconventional—I didn't start with a CS degree or a pre-planned career path. I started as a Virtual Assistant at my first company, but I had this inherent drive to make things work perfectly, to find what was broken before users did. My engineering manager noticed this obsession with quality and suggested I transition into testing. That conversation changed my career trajectory.

I believe good QA is about **thinking ahead**. It's not just running tests; it's asking "what could go wrong?" before it reaches production, automating the repetitive stuff so the team can focus on what matters, and communicating findings clearly. But more than that—it's about being someone who **cares deeply** about quality in everything they do.

## My Journey

### **Company 1 - From VA to QA (Learning the Fundamentals)**

**Virtual Assistant → QA Tester (0-5 months)**
- Started as a Virtual Assistant handling administrative tasks
- Noticed bugs and inconsistencies that others weren't catching
- Flagged issues consistently; engineering manager noticed my attention to detail
- Manager encouraged me to transition to QA testing
- **The turning point:** Realized I wanted to prevent bugs, not just report them

**Manual QA Tester (5 months - 1 years)**
- Built strong foundation in test case design, SDLC/STLC, and defect reporting
- Learned to trace requirements through test coverage
- Worked directly with developers to understand their perspective
- Mentored myself on industry best practices and testing methodologies
- **Key learning:** Testing is about thinking like a user AND like an engineer

**Learning Automation (8 months in)**
- Felt limited by manual testing; recognized automation as next career step
- Started learning Playwright (no CS background made this challenging at first)
- Built my first automation framework using Page Object Model
- Struggled initially—debugging flaky tests, understanding async/await, TypeScript typing
- **Breakthrough:** Realized that persistence + curiosity trumps formal education

### **Company 2 - After Acquisition (Production-Scale QA) **

**Associate QA Engineer (2 years)**
- First company acquired; merged with second organization
- Transitioned automation framework to new infrastructure
- Reduced regression testing time by **45%** through strategic test selection
- Started leading automation efforts for my team
- **Key learning:** Scaling tests is easy; scaling quality culture is hard

**Mid-Level QA (Promoted, 1 year)**
- Promoted to mid-level QA role
- Learned CI/CD integration deeply from senior QA engineers (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins, Harness)
- Contributed to bug reporting workflows and severity classification initiatives
- Participated in test planning and RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix) creation
- Scaled automation framework from 20 to 80+ test cases across multiple projects
- Worked closely with best senior QA engineers who shaped how I approach testing
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams (Product, Engineering, DevOps)
- **Key learnings:**
  - CI/CD isn't just about running tests faster; it's about feedback loops
  - Good test planning prevents team chaos during releases
  - Learning from experienced engineers accelerates your growth exponentially

### **The Layoff & What's Next**

In 2025, my second company went through restructuring, and I was affected. But here's the thing—I don't see this as a setback. I see it as validation that I have skills worth investing in, and an opportunity to be intentional about my next role.

**What I did after:**
- Deepened my Playwright skills with TypeScript strict typing and advanced patterns
- Built this portfolio with production-like examples (not just templates)
- Studied advanced testing: accessibility testing, visual regression, API testing
- Reflected on 4+ years of lessons and what I want to do next
- **What this taught me:** Resilience isn't about never failing—it's about learning, adapting, and staying hungry

## What I'm Good At

✅ **Test Design & Strategy**  
Designing test scenarios that actually catch bugs. I think about edge cases, error paths, and what users will actually do—not just the happy path.

✅ **Automation Framework Architecture**  
Building scalable, maintainable frameworks. Page Object Model, role-based fixtures, proper logging—the stuff that makes tests easy to write and debug.

✅ **CI/CD Integration & Test Pipelines**  
Not just running tests—building feedback loops. GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Harness, Saucelabs. Making sure tests add value, not just noise.

✅ **Clear Defect Communication**  
Writing bug reports developers actually want to read. Steps, expected vs. actual, environment details, reproduction rate. Context matters.

✅ **Learning from the Best**  
I've been fortunate to work with senior QA engineers who shaped my approach to testing. Their mentorship taught me not just the how, but the why behind quality practices.

✅ **Learning Without a Safety Net**  
No CS background? That meant I had to be resourceful, persistent, and humble. I learned Playwright by doing, by failing, by asking questions. That's a skill.

## My Impact (Real Numbers)

- **45% reduction** in regression test execution time through strategic test selection and automation
- Built and maintained **80+ automated tests** across multiple projects and features
- Maintained **96% test pass rate** while scaling framework and adding new tests
- **0 critical production incidents** from untested code paths in features I QA'd
- Promoted from Associate to Mid-Level QA based on contributions to testing infrastructure
- Contributed to **test planning and RTM creation** for major releases
- Participated in **CI/CD pipeline** optimization that reduced release cycle time

## What I'm Looking For

After 4+ years of building testing infrastructure and learning across two companies, I'm looking for a role where I can:

- **Contribute to teams that value quality** — not just speed
- **Build scalable testing frameworks** with other people who care about architecture
- **Continue learning and growing** from experienced QA engineers and strong teams
- **Work on products with real users** where my testing prevents actual problems
- **Stay technical and keep improving** — always learning, always growing

**Types of roles that excite me:**
- QA Engineer / Automation QA Engineer (mid-level or senior)
- QA Engineer in teams with mature CI/CD practices
- Roles that blend manual testing expertise with automation skills
- Teams building testing culture, not just test suites
- Companies where QA is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought

**What I bring:**
- Proven ability to learn new technologies without formal CS training
- Experience taking automation from 20 to 80+ tests
- Strong foundation in both manual and automation testing
- CI/CD pipeline experience and knowledge
- Growth mindset and proven ability to learn quickly
- Resilience and determination to improve

## Why This Portfolio?

This isn't a collection of templates. This is how I actually think and work:

- **Manual Testing Docs** → Real test cases showing my thought process
- **Playwright Framework** → Production-like architecture, not a hello-world demo
- **QA Strategy** → My actual philosophy on testing, not corporate buzzwords
- **ABOUT_ME** → My real story, not a polished resume

I'm not claiming to be perfect. My automation framework has room to grow, and I'm actively expanding it. But what's here is *authentic*, it's *solid*, and it reflects how I approach QA.

## One Thing I Want Recruiters to Know

I didn't start with a CS degree or a predetermined plan to be in QA. I got here because I care deeply about quality and I'm willing to work hard to be good at what I do.

The layoff in 2025 wasn't about my skills—it was about business decisions. What it *did* teach me is that I have value, that I'm resilient, and that I want to work somewhere I can grow.

I'm looking for a team that believes in those same things.
